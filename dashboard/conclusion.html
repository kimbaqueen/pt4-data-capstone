                <p class="description-text">
                    After examining the data, it was clear that gender equity pay biases still exist today. While there
                    are many underlying factors at play, our dataframe sets confirmed that women were trending below men
                    on the pay scale across departments and job functions as a majority.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of representation, Women made up more than 90% of the Marketing Associate roles. However,
                    this
                    was one of the highest disparity job title groups for base pay between genders. The Engineering
                    department had the largest difference of average base pay between genders, with women making up less
                    than 10% of this department for comparison.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Other interesting findings were Base Pay and Bonus Pay were negatively correlated for both genders.
                    Age and Base Pay was positively correlated for both genders. Still, when analyzing Average Base Pay
                    against age between genders, women were still trailing behind in all department categories.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Potential shortfalls of this project are around the data collection and integrity of data reported
                    online. There is not much transparency in salaries across job functions, gender, and other HR
                    sensitive metrics. Even if a company does have this information, they may not make it publicly
                    available due to fear of public retaliation or other legal implication risks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In future enhancements to this project's research, I'd like to find and explore more specific data
                    on women of color and other underrepresented groups. In particular, representation of women of color
                    rising the ranks in leadership roles across
                    departments and industries, and their respective salaries in comparison to caucasian women and men.

                    While having conversations in the workplace about DEI is important, it's not enough. To impact
                    meaningful change we must be willing to accept some degree of risk and take a candid inventory of
                    where the company and industry stands. Look for meaningful metrics. Treat DEI like any other company
                    initiative
                    that needs to get results and be ready to act on what you find.
